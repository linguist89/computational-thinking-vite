# Lesson 2: Understanding Real-World Problems

## Defining real-world problems: Scale, complexity, and impact

In the realm of computational thinking, defining real-world problems is an essential first step in problem-solving. This definition needs to identify the scale, complexity, and impact of the problem, all of which greatly influence the strategies used to solve it.

**Scale**

Scale pertains to the size or extent of the problem. Is it an issue that affects just one person, a whole community, a city, a nation, or the entire world? The scale can also refer to the amount of data involved or the computational power required to process that data. Defining the scale of a problem will influence the computational methods used. For example, problems of a larger scale might need distributed computing, big data analytics, or scalable algorithms to handle large datasets effectively.

**Complexity**

Complexity refers to the number of elements or factors involved in the problem and how they interact. Complex problems may involve multiple interconnected parts, have several potential solutions, or be contingent on a variety of variables. Complexity also refers to the difficulty of the problem-solving process itself. For instance, a problem may require a multitude of mathematical operations, involve multi-level abstraction, or need advanced machine learning techniques for its resolution. Understanding the complexity of a problem can help in devising an efficient and effective problem-solving strategy.

**Impact**

The impact of a problem refers to the consequences or effects that arise if it remains unsolved, or the potential benefits if it is solved. It's crucial to understand the broader social, economic, environmental, or other implications of the problem. In computational problem-solving, considering the impact can guide prioritization and resource allocation. High-impact problems might warrant more immediate attention or the allocation of more resources. Conversely, lower-impact problems might be deprioritized or solved with less computationally intensive methods.

By understanding and defining the scale, complexity, and impact of real-world problems, one can leverage computational thinking to devise effective solutions. These three parameters not only influence the kind of techniques or algorithms that would be suitable for solving the problem but also aid in prioritizing the problems to be solved, thus enabling a more efficient and impactful problem-solving process.

## Role of problem solving in addressing real-world problems

Problem solving is the essence of human innovation and progress. It serves as a key driver for advancements in every field, from healthcare to technology, and is especially critical in the realm of computational thinking. Addressing real-world problems through problem solving involves recognizing an issue, defining it clearly, and then leveraging computational resources and strategies to devise a solution. The role of problem solving in addressing real-world problems is multifaceted, and we will delve into some of its key aspects below.

**Identification and Definition of Problems**

The first step in problem-solving is the identification and definition of the problem. It requires an understanding of the situation, recognizing an issue, and then clearly articulating it. This stage is pivotal as a well-defined problem often points towards its solution. A clear problem definition also allows for a better understanding of the scale, complexity, and impact of the issue at hand, thus setting the stage for effective problem-solving strategies.

**Developing and Implementing Solutions**

Once the problem is well defined, the next step involves developing and implementing solutions. In the computational world, this might involve designing algorithms, creating models, or leveraging big data analytics. The methods chosen depend on the scale and complexity of the problem. For instance, simple problems might require straightforward algorithms, while complex problems might necessitate the use of advanced machine learning techniques. Implementing the solution may also require considering the potential impact of the problem and adjusting the strategies accordingly.

**Evaluation of Solutions**

Problem-solving doesn't end with implementing a solution. It also involves assessing the effectiveness of the solution. This step involves testing the solution under various conditions, analyzing the outcomes, and refining the solution as needed. Evaluation allows for the continual improvement of the solution and ensures that it is adequately addressing the problem.

**Learning and Adapting**

Every problem-solving effort, whether successful or not, offers valuable lessons. By reflecting on the problem-solving process, one can gain insights into the strategies that worked, those that didn't, and why. This learning enables us to better handle similar problems in the future, continually improving our problem-solving skills.

In conclusion, problem-solving plays a pivotal role in addressing real-world problems. It allows us to identify, understand, and define problems, develop and implement solutions, evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions, and learn and adapt from each problem-solving experience. With computational thinking and problem-solving skills, we are better equipped to tackle the myriad challenges the world presents.
